I'm working in Avid Media Composer First and am trying to get a hold of some half-decent effects. I downloaded NewBlueFX Prime via the link provided when accessing my Avid master account. However, the NewBlue effects are not accessible from the Effect Palette in MCF and when I find them individually in the Source Browser as .fex and .fxt files, it says that they're not supported for import. It then asks if I want to link and consolidate/transcode it to which I click 
For a music gear for sale demo video I want to edit out my hands turning and twisting knobs on an amplifier and some pedals (gear heads are obsessing over settings so it would be nice to feature them in close-up) Here's a 10 second clip: https://youtu.be/g0wB0MvLMDA Audio must be synced to demo real-time changes in sound so stop-motion isn't viable (nor practical). Tried filming with a fixed camera POW, moving the knobs with some green objects and masking the knobs that's being twisted This entire season feels just like it was structed and filmed thinking that they would have 12-14 episodes ,but then out of the blue fx cut it to 10 episodes ,because producers,and Ryan got in the most annoying situation to find a easy and fast way to wrap it somehow. At this point there are near zero chances to not make the ending not feel rushed and don't let plot holes. I believe that Ryan thought he will have 14 episodes eitherwise in my oppinion he would combined in each episode a little.

Any suggestions that don’t involve getting a strat. Hey all, not really a hobbyist here, getting my first lightsaber here. I’m looking to get a lightsaber mostly for display and to admire. I might swing it around a little but I doubt I’ll do it that much. I Guess there are pros and cons to each saber. The Graflex is more for sturdy and can take more hits but it’s not exactly a replica, just similar. The signature series one is a replica but I don’t think it’s as sturdy as the Graflex. The Graflex also can be repaired but the signature series. </p>
