In a thread I made a month ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/8i9k6v/what_if_exe_was_canon/), I asked "what if EXE was canon?" (My first post on this sub, BTW). Now I am curious to see what you guys would think would happen if Sonic.EXE (the character, not the game) met the characters one by one. Rules: Don't just say "Murder". While the most likely thing to happen, let's pretend like he wants to "play" with them for a few minutes. Also, remember this is all fun and games. https://youtu.be/nEHCGrUK\-l8 (https://youtu.be/nEHCGrUK-l8). Warning: i'm new to this subreddit and i'm not used the formatting so sorry.

Before everyone descends in a frenzy of trading and pack-cracking, it's a good idea to look at which cards in the set are likely going to be the most sought-after. This should help guide players, traders, and deck-builders alike. To facilitate this, I will be highlighting cards and combos that I expect to see play, based on the existing Japanese metagame as well as general predictions. amp#x200B; 1.

Ultimate is being billed as the biggest Smash yet. While that may be true, it’s missing a surprising amount of content compared to previous installments. Here’s everything that is NOT in Ultimate, because I’m a pessimist and I have way too much free time on my hands. #CHARACTERS Nobody. Everyone is here! #STAGES Smash 64 - Sector Z (Star Fox) - only appeared in 64. Functionally identical to Corneria. EDIT: I stand corrected, apparently Sector Z is much bigger. 
Hi everyone. A couple of days ago /u/sergioberg79 posted a 'Still Alive on Vive Controllers' video. Now you can play your own songs on Vive Controllers (or Knuckles, if you have them) too! Source code can be found at Github (https://github.com/m3gagluk/midivive/). To get started you should download the latest release from the Releases tab, unzip it, start SteamVR and launch the file from the command line: `midivive.exe -i ltyour midi file.midgt` You can make the sound louder or quieter. The more I'm becoming aware of everything, the more I realize. I realize that his abuse isn't just physical things, it isn't just pure manipulation, it's also the little things. When I'm watching a TV show, he grabs his phone and starts playing YouTube videos. He holds his phone only a couple inches away from my face, so there's literally no other place for me to look other than at the screen. I can't watch what I want to. When we are in the same room, I have to be sitting Ben the Human part 2, enjoy! amp#x200B; Prologue (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/a5l2m2/galaxy_of_chaos_humanity_101/) Previous (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/abb1dm/galaxy_of_chaos_ben_the_human/) Next (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/abya8v/galaxy_of_chaos_ben_the_human_part_3/) amp#x200B; The two entered campus, making their way towards Clentara’s dorm.

A sigh echoed through the small dark room, a young man with messy brown hair sat at a desk by his bedroom window; he was beginning to look frustrated more and more by the second as he scrolled deeper into an art reference gallery on his laptop. ¨Kenny!” a young woman cheerfully yelled in a soft loving tone ¨lunch is ready!¨. ¨Coming!¨ he yelled back in a high raspy voice, he got up stretched then began heading towards the stairs; after closing his laptop, turning off his rooms light what if zero.exe appear in Megaman Star Force 3 as Virus/wizard Hybrid with boy with Geo Stelar-age(maybe 11 year-old) as partner? amp#x200B; zero.exe with boy make EM Wave Change and the stella police notice a EM Wave Change with human and EM virus.

Not sure if anyone else has made a post like this, but I would like to share my predictions for DLC Mii Costumes. I think there will be 6 packs, each with 8 costumes (and headgear to go with them). Most (if not all) of the missing Mii gear will come back, including third-party Mii gear. I have come up with several new costumes as well. I will go through them by pack. Note: The headgear that comes with costumes specific to one type of Mii Fighter can be worn by all types. PACK 1 Fancy. Hey, I compiled this list of all of the content that was present in previous Smash games that has not yet been confirmed or deconfirmed for Smash Ultimate. I use the word "unconfirmed" as meaning something has not yet been confirmed or deconfirmed, so in other words meaning that we do not know yet. For some things (such as trophies, stickers, custom equipment, etc.) there was simply too much to list, so I just grouped that all together into one listing. For Mii Costumes, I decided Keep in mind, mii costumes don't deconfirm fighter characters. Personally I'm hoping for: Waluigi Overalls (Swordfighter) Mario Overalls (Brawler) Luigi Overalls (Gunner) Wario Overalls (Brawler) Minecraft Steve (Swordfighter) (Minecraft Alex for female mii) Master Chief (Gunner) Super Punchout Little Mac (Brawler) Dr Wright (Swordfighter) Koopa Outfit (Brawler) Tingle (Brawler) Dark Samus (Brawler) Girahim (Swordfighter) Lyn (Swordfighter) Magnus (Swordfighter). I totally understand that she is trying to sabotage our relationship. They were together/married for 2 years and and have been divorced for 10. He is 38 and I am 39. But regardless of how logical I am in realizing what she is trying to do, it's affecting my mental state and making me question him. Earlier this week, his ex-wife whom he hasn't seen (to my knowledge) since the divorce sent me a huge bunch of vitriolic messages on FB, spouting all the shit he did to her, what his family It won’t matter anymore. One day, the memory will pass through you quicker than a shiver: a drowsy moment spent within the heat of their arms, your low-lidded gaze catching theirs, those seconds that felt like separate universes, things unspoken and felt, right before you both drifted off to sleep – did it mean anything? Did I mean anything? Did any of it matter? These questions will haunt you, more relentless than shadows and the sweetness of the memories that keep you shackled where 
So, about last March my ex cheated on me. I expected it really, our relationship had been tumbling downhill for a good bit sadly. I was devastated but at the end of the day, she claimed she didn't want to hurt me and that's why she didn't tell me. I decided if I loved her I had to let her leave. Before the breakup, I had vented to a lot of mutual friends of ours that it was going downhill, so if it did, I wouldn't look like the bad guy. I've always been known for making breakups My wonderful boyfriend and I have been together for 13 months and he has stayed on first base the entire time, without complaint. According to him, he loves me so much and I'm worth it, so he's willing to wait. amp#x200B; There were a few times where he got too "excited" during a makeout and got too handsy (try to remove clothing etc). It would be very overwhelming and upsetting for me, so we decided that the ball is on my court and we'd go at my pace. He's so fucking patient and amazing. 1. Banjo-Kazooie (Banjo Kazooie) 2.
